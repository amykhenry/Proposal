abstract = {We measured the rate of advance of urchin (Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis) feeding aggregations (fronts) as they destructively grazed kelp beds (Laminaria longicruris) at both a wave-exposed site and a sheltered site in Nova Scotia over 3.5 years. The grazing fronts were composed of high densities of large adults (up to 98 and 70 per 0.25 m(2) at the exposed and sheltered sites, respectively). Urchins in the recently formed barrens, or in adjacent kelp beds, occurred at much lower densities and consisted mainly of juveniles. The fronts moved onshore into shallower water at each site, but their rate of advance varied markedly between sites and over time at each site, ranging from 0 to 4 m.month(-1). The rate of advance of a front was related to the biomass of urchins; fronts did not advance below a threshold biomass of similar to 2 kg.m(-2). Infestations of kelp by an epiphytic bryozoan (Membranipora membranacea) caused marked reductions in kelp canopy cover and biomass during winter, but the canopy regenerated through recruitment of juvenile sporophytes in spring. A localized outbreak of disease decimated S. droebachiensis at the exposed site in 1993, which enabled kelp to recolonize the barrens. Surviving urchins gradually reaggregated and resumed destructive grazing after similar to 1.5 years. A recurrence of disease in 1995 eliminated urchins at both sites and terminated the transition from kelp beds to barrens on a coastal scale. Our findings have important implications for the management of the urchin fishery, which targets grazing fronts for harvesting.},

abstract = {While the species level effects of marine reserves are widely recognized, community level shifts due to marine reserves have only recently been documented. Protection from fishing of top predators may lead to trophic cascades, which have community-wide implications. Disease may act in a similar manner, regulating population levels of dominant species within a community. Two decades of data from the Channel Islands National Park Service's Kelp Forest Monitoring database allowed us to compare the effects of fishing and urchin disease on rocky reef community patterns and dynamics. Different size-frequency distributions of urchins inside and outside of reserves indicated reduced predation on urchins at sites where fishing removes urchin predators. Rocky reefs inside reserves were more likely to support kelp forests than were fished areas. We suggest that this results from cascading effects of the fishery on urchin predators outside the reserves, which releases herbivores (urchins) from predation. After periods of prevalent urchin disease, the reef community shifted more towards kelp forest assemblages. Specific groups of algae and invertebrates were associated with kelp forest and barrens communities. The community dynamics leading to transitions between kelp forests and barrens are driven by both fishing and disease; however the fishery effect was of greater magnitude. This study further confirms the importance of marine reserves not only for fisheries conservation, but also for the conservation of historically dominant community types.},

Although the dynamic implications of compartmentalization have been debated for at least four decades, a general answer has remained elusive. Here, we unambiguously demonstrate that compartmentalization acts to increase the persistence of multitrophic food webs. We then identify the mechanisms behind this result. Compartments in food webs act directly to buffer the propagation of extinctions throughout the community and augment the long-term persistence of its constituent species. This contribution to persistence is greater the more complex the food web, which helps to reconcile the simultaneous complexity and stability of natural communities.},

We evaluate these questions with regard to the effects of various types of disturbance for as much as three decades on the populations of several species of kelp in the large kelp forest off Point Loma, San Diego, California. The most sensitive population factors we studied include recruitment, density, and survivorship. Patch stability was evaluated with regard to the persistence of patches already well established in 1971---1972.

To investigate what happens when a trophic cascade pushes a host population over a host-threshold density, I analyzed a 20-year data set of kelp forest communities at 16 sites in the region of the Channel Islands National Park, California, USA. Historically, lobsters, and perhaps other predators, kept urchin populations at low levels and kelp forests developed a community-level trophic cascade. In geographic areas where the main predators on urchins were fished, urchin populations increased to the extent that they overgrazed algae and starvation eventually limited urchin-population growth. Despite the limitation of urchin population size by food availability, urchin densities, at times, well exceeded the host-density threshold for epidemics. An urchin-specific bacterial disease entered the region after 1992 and acted as a density-dependent mortality source. Dense populations were more likely to experience epidemics and suffer higher mortality. Disease did not reduce the urchin population at a site to the density that predators previously did. Therefore, disease did not fully replace predators in the trophic cascade. These results indicate how fishing top predators can indirectly favor disease transmission in prey populations.},

abstract = {Evidence from field and laboratory data indicates that warmer ocean temperatures likely play a critical role in the disease dynamics of intertidal populations of the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. Urchin populations along the west coast of North America have experienced numerous disease epidemics in the past several decades, and yet little is known about disease transmission, the geographic extent, or contributing factors to these outbreaks. In this study, we examine disease in Pacific Strongylocentrotus urchins over a broad geographic range with repeated sampling. We suggest that what has been assumed to be a single disease might be two distinct diseases presenting two disparate pathologies. Both potential pathologies were extremely rare or absent north of Point Conception, California, in a region associated with strong upwelling and cooler water temperatures but were common at warmer sites in southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico. Furthermore, during the survey period, disease prevalence at some of the study sites was positively correlated with sea surface temperatures as estimated from satellite data, leading us to hypothesize that heat stress may increase urchin susceptibility to disease. In experimentally elevated water temperatures, diseased individuals had significantly larger lesions and a significantly lower gonadal index, which could have important implications for urchin population dynamics.},

abstract = {Many factors (climate warming, pollution, harvesting, introduced species) can contribute to disease outbreaks in marine life. Concomitant increases in each of these makes it difficult to attribute recent changes in disease occurrence or severity to any one factor. For example, the increase in disease of Caribbean coral is postulated to be a result of climate change and introduction of terrestrial pathogens. Indirect evidence exists that (a) warming increased disease in turtles; (b) protection, pollution, and terrestrial pathogens increased mammal disease; (c) aquaculture increased disease in mollusks; and (d) release from overfished predators increased sea urchin disease. In contrast, fishing and pollution may have reduced disease in fishes. In other taxa (e.g., sea grasses, crustaceans, sharks), there is little evidence that disease has changed over time. The diversity of patterns suggests there are many ways that environmental change can interact with disease in the ocean.},

abstract = {Between 1978 and 1996 benthic communities in the Leigh Marine Reserve shifted from being dominated by sea urchins to being dominated by macroalgae. This was a result of a trophic cascade thought to be an indirect effect of increased predator abundance. We assessed further changes in communities from 1996 to 2000, differences in benthic communities between reserve and adjacent unprotected sites, and the stability of these patterns from 1999 to 2001. Since 1996, densities of sea urchins Evechinus chloroticus have continued to decline in shallow areas of the reserve (< 8 m), and all sites classified as urchin barrens in 1978. are now dominated by large brown algae. Comparisons between reserve and non-reserve sites revealed differences consistent with a trophic cascade at reserve sites. The greatest differences in algal communities between reserve and non-reserve sites occurred at depths where E. chloroticus was most abundant (4 to 6 m). Reserve sites had lower urchin densities and reduced extent of urchin barrens habitat with higher biomass of the 2 dominant algal species (Ecklonia radiata and Caipophyllum maschalocarpum). At reserve sites densities of exposed E. chloroticus (openly grazing the substratum) declined so that urchin barrens were completely absent by 2001. Lower density of the limpet Cellana stellifera and higher densities of the turbinid gastropod Cookia sulcata at reserve sites are thought to be responses to changes in habitat structure, representing additional indirect effects of increased predators. The overall difference in community types between reserve and non-reserve sites remained stab le between 1999 and 2001. Localised urchin mortality events due to an unknown agent were recorded at some sites adjacent to the marine reserve. Only at 1 of these sites did exposed urchins decline below the critical density of 1 m(-2), which resulted in the total replacement of urchin barrens with macroalgae-dominated habitats. At other sites urchin barrens have remained stable. Declines in the limpet C. stellifera occurred across all sites between 1999 and 2001 and may be indirectly associated with urchin declines. Long-term changes in benthic communities in the Leigh reserve and the stability of differences between reserve and non-reserve sites over time are consistent with gradual declines in urchin densities due to increased predation on urchins, thus providing further evidence for a trophic cascade in this system. The rapid declines in urchin numbers at some unprotected sites, however, demonstrate how short-term disturbances, such as disease, may result in shifts in community types over much shorter time frames.},

Lesions of diseased specimens from two locations in France, La Ciotat (Mediterranean Sea) and Morgat (Atlantic Ocean), are examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and the diversity of their microbiota is analysed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA gene clones libraries construction. Microscopic observations demonstrated that only the central area of the lesions is invaded by bacteria but not the peripheral zone and the surrounding healthy tissues. Molecular analysis identified at least 24 bacterial genomospecies in bald sea urchin lesions: 5 are Alphaproteohacteria, 10 are Gammaproteobacteria, 8 are CFB bacteria and I is a Fusobacteria. Out of them, 4 are observed in both locations while 10 occur only in the Atlantic Ocean and 10 only in the Mediterranean Sea. Gammaproteobacteria are the most represented in clones libraries from both locations, with respectively 65% and 43% of the total clones. CFB and Alphaproteobacteria accounted for the majority of the remaining clones and were detected by DGGE in virtually all samples from both stations. Our results demonstrate that bacterial communities observed on diseased individuals of the same echinoid species but originating from distinct locations are not similar and thus support the hypothesis that bacteria involved in the worldwide echinoid disease commonly called the bald sea urchin disease are opportunistic and not specific.

abstract = {The rocky subtidal ecosystem of the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia is characterised by 2 community states, kelp beds and urchin barrens that alternate on a decadal time scale. While the shift from barrens to a kelp bed requires a large perturbation, namely a disease outbreak causing urchin mass mortality, the reverse shift is more gradual and mediated by the formation and propagation of destructive grazing aggregations (or fronts) of sea urchins Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis. We have developed a spatial model for the re-establishment of kelp beds and the formation of a feeding front of urchins in order to describe transitions (phase shifts) between kelp bed and barrens states following an urchin mass mortality event. Our model includes size-specific movement, growth, and survival of urchins, as well as growth of kelp and grazing by urchins. The position of the kelp bed-barrens interface (or grazing front) predicted by our model is in general agreement with field observations at 2 sites and for up to 7 yr after a mass mortality event. Elasticity analysis showed that daily foraging movements by individual urchins have the greatest effect on the position of the feeding front and the density of the urchins there. Survival and recruitment rates of urchins also have large effects on urchin density at the front. The density of urchin populations in deep-water thermal refuges (from a disease agent) and the distance between these source populations and remnant or emergent kelp beds have large effects on the time required for the re-formation of a feeding front after an event of urchin mass mortality. These findings suggest that site-specific characteristics should be taken into account in the development of sustainable harvesting strategies and habitat-based management of the urchin fishery.},

abstract = {Pathogens transmitted by arthropod vectors are common in human populations, agricultural systems and natural communities. Transmission of these vector-borne pathogens depends on the population dynamics of the vector species as well as its interactions with other species within the community. In particular, predation may be sufficient to control pathogen prevalence indirectly via the vector. To examine the indirect effect of predators on vectored-pathogen dynamics, we developed a theoretical model that integrates predator-prey and host-pathogen theory. We used this model to determine whether predation can prevent pathogen persistence or alter the stability of host-pathogen dynamics. We found that, in the absence of predation, pathogen prevalence in the host increases with vector fecundity, whereas predation on the vector causes pathogen prevalence to decline, or even become extinct, with increasing vector fecundity. We also found that predation on a vector may drastically slow the initial spread of a pathogen. The predator can increase host abundance indirectly by reducing or eliminating infection in the host population. These results highlight the importance of studying interactions that, within the greater community, may alter our predictions when studying disease dynamics. From an applied perspective, these results also suggest situations where an introduced predator or the natural enemies of a vector may slow the rate of spread of an emerging vector-borne pathogen.},

abstract = {Many infectious diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that reside in nonhuman animal reservoirs and are transmitted to humans via the bite of an arthropod vector. Most vectors feed from a variety of host species that differ dramatically in their reservoir competence; that is, their probability of transmitting the infection from host to vector. We explore a conceptual model of what we termed the ``dilution effect,'' whereby the presence of vertebrate hosts with a low capacity to infect feeding vectors (incompetent reservoirs) dilute the effect of highly competent reservoirs, thus reducing disease risk. Using Lyme disease as an example, we demonstrate the presence and estimate the magnitude of the dilution effect for local sites in eastern New York State. We found that the prevalence of Lyme disease spirochetes, Borrelia burgdorferi, in field-collected Ixodes ticks (37.6% and 70.5% for nymphal and adult stages, respectively) was dramatically lower than expected (∼90% and >95% for nymphal and adult stages...},

abstract = {1. A food web is presented which describes trophic interactions among the herbivores, parasitoids, predators and pathogens associated with broom, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link. The data come from published work on the community at a single site. The web comprises a total of 154 taxa: one plant, 19 herbivores, 66 parasitoids, 60 predators, five omnivores and three pathogens. There are 370 trophic links between these taxa in the web. The taxa form 82 functionally distinct groups, called trophic species.2. Predators consumed significantly more species than did parasitoids: a median of two prey species per species of predator (range = 1-9), compared to a median of one host species per species of parasitoid (range = 1-4). Significant differences in the number of species consumed were also found among the five predator groups: birds (median = 4), spiders (median = 5), Coleoptera (median = 1), Diptera (median = 2) and Hemiptera (median = 7).3. Vulnerability, measured by numbers of consumer species, was significantly affected by the herbivores' feeding styles: externally feeding herbivores were most vulnerable and the concealed herbivores were least vulnerable. Miners were vulnerable to the most parasitoid species and externally feeding herbivores were the most vulnerable to predators.4. Resource species had a median vulnerability of 13 consumer species, a figure far higher than that in most published food webs. No significant relationship was found between species' vulnerability to predators and vulnerability to parasitoids. However, there was a strong negative relationship between the percentage mortality due to predation and percentage mortality due to parasitism.5. The broom food web contains nine orders of insects, a figure higher than previously recorded. The web also contains vertebrates, arachnids, bacteria and fungi. Most of the interactions between the orders were weak. Connectance was calculated for the complete web, the parasitoid sub-web and the predator sub-web. The connectance of the predator sub-web, a value of 0.0364, was more than an order of magnitude larger than the connectance of the entire web (0.0156) or the parasitoid sub-web (0.018).6. The body lengths of 52 species in the food web were estimated from field guides or museum specimens. Larger predators consumed smaller prey in 93% of predator-prey interactions. Smaller parasitoids consumed larger hosts in 79% of parasitoid-host interactions. Parasitoids were significantly smaller than predators.7. The 52 species were arranged in order of increasing body length along the columns and down the rows of a food web matrix. The predator sub-web was predominantly upper triangular with 8% of non-zero elements falling below the leading diagonal. The parasitoid sub-web was predominantly lower triangular with 21% non-zero elements falling above the leading diagonal. The entire web contains entries both above and below the main diagonal and thus violates a central assumption of the cascade model.},

abstract = {Vibrio tubiashii is a re-emerging pathogen of molluscs that secretes a variety of extracellular products (ECPs), including a metalloprotease and a cytolysin/haemolysin. Previously, we reported that the V tubiashii haemolysin locus consists of two ORFs (vthB and vthA), similar to that of the homologous haemolysin genes (vvhB and vvhA) found in Vibrio, vulnificus. Here, we demonstrate that the concomitant expression of both V tubiashii genes resulted in significantly higher haemolytic activity than the vthA gene alone. In addition, we created a VthAB(-) mutant strain of V tubiashii that was virtually devoid of haemolytic activity in liquid media. Interestingly, significant production of an additional haemolysin(s) was observed on blood plates. Moreover, we have previously reported that in V tubiashii, proteolytic and haemolytic activities are inversely produced during bacterial growth. Here, we study this correlation in more detail and present evidence that the VtpA metalloprotease inhibits haemolytic activity in culture supernatants, based on the following evidence: (i) loss of metalloprotease activity by either mutation or EDTA inhibition resulted in increased haemolytic activity; (ii) overexpression of the vtpA gene resulted in decreased haemolytic activity, (iii) purified VtpA metalloprotease directly diminished haemolytic activity by purified VthA haemolysin. Importantly, we found not only that vthAB gene expression remained high throughout growth but also that there were no dramatic differences in vthAB gene expression between the parent and VtpA(-) mutant strains. Thus, our results strongly suggest that the V tubiashii metalloprotease directly targets its haemolysin.},

The average productivity over four seasons was 1.28 $\pm$ 0.28 gCm−2 day−1 (mean $\pm$ standard deviation, n = 4). Bacterial productivity was measured five times throughout a year using the rate of tritiated thymidine incorporated into DNA. Average values were 33 $\pm$ 12 mg C m−2 day−1 for sediment and 23 $\pm$ 4 for water column (n = 5). Spatial variability between samples was greater than seasonal variation for both seagrass productivity and bacterial productivity. On one occasion, bacterial productivity was measured using the rate of 32P incorporated into phospholipid. The values were c...},

Many of these disease agents are harbored in rodent populations, and humans are victims of "accidental" transmission. Here we explore the idea that predatory vertebrates indirectly protect human health by reducing population size of rodent reservoirs of human disease. Research frontiers include the importance of rodent population density to the incidence of human disease, as opposed to behavior or age structure effects; the roles of different types of predators in determining both population dynamics and rodent density per se; and the effects of human-caused environmental change on predators and their rodent prey. A better understanding of these basic ecological issues will inform both environmental and health policy.},

abstract = {The work presented here reports the expression of immune-related genes during ontogenesis in the oyster Crassostrea gigar. Expression patterns of 18 selected genes showed that RNAs detected in oocytes and 2-4 cell embryos are of maternal origin and that gene transcription starts early after fertilization. The expression patterns of 4 genes (Cg-timp, Cg-tal, Cg-EcSOD and Drac3) suggested that hemocytes appear in the gastrula-trochophore stages. The localization of Cg-tal expression suggested that hematopoietic cells were derived from vessels and/or artery endothelia cells. Moreover, a bacterial challenge affected the level of expression of genes. Indeed, a change in expression levels was observed for Cg-LBP/BPI, Cg-timp, Drac3 and Cg-MyD88 genes in larval stages upon exposure to non-pathogenic bacteria. In early juveniles, a modulation was also observed for Cg-LBP/BPI, Cg-timp, Cg-MyD88 and for Cg-tal, according to the concentration of bacteria. Altogether, the results showed that studying the appearance of immunocompetent cells through their ability to express immune-related genes is a tool to gain insight the ontogenesis of the oyster immune system.

abstract = {Oysters are permanently exposed to various microbes, and their defense system is continuously solicited to prevent accumulation of invading and pathogenic organisms. Therefore, impairment of the animal's defense system usually results in mass mortalities in cultured oyster stocks or increased bacterial loads in food products intended for human consumption. In the present study, experiments were conducted to examine the effects of stress on the juvenile oyster's resistance to the oyster pathogen Vibrio splendidus. Oysters (Crassostrea gigas) were challenged with a low dose of a pathogenic V. splendidus strain and subjected Co a mechanical stress V days later. Both mortality and V. splendidus loads increased in stressed oysters, whereas they remained low in unstressed animals, Injection of noradrenaline or adrenocorticotropic hormone, two key components of the oyster neuroendocrine stress response system, also caused higher mortality and increased accumulation of I;. splendidus in challenged oysters. These results suggest that the physiological changes imposed by stress, or stress hormones, influenced host-pathogen interactions in oysters and increased juvenile C. gigas vulnerability to Vibrio splendidus.},

Successful prediction in complex systems requires empirically accessible theoretical frameworks to limit the range of possible outcomes. I explored the predictions of multispecies Markov models, based on transition probabilities derived from repeated censuses of fixed points in the middle intertidal community of Tatoosh Island, Washington, USA, under natural conditions and after altering the model to reflect species extinction and changes in size-structured processes. The unmanipulated model predicted a mussel-dominated community and quantitatively captured 98.7% of the variation in community composition in independent transects. Although model assumptions that transition probabilities did not vary over time and depended only on the state of a point at the previous census were violated, altering the model to account for these violations pro...},

abstract = {The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, is extensively cultivated and represents an important economic activity. Oysters are reared in estuarine areas, subjected to various biotic and abiotic factors. One of the limiting factors in aquaculture is mortality outbreaks, which may limit oyster production, and the causes of these outbreaks are not completely understood. In this context, the effects of temperature and salinity on Pacific oyster, C. gigas, haemocytes, were studied. Haemocytes are the invertebrate blood cells and thus have been shown to be involved in defence mechanisms. Flow cytometry was used for monitoring several haemocyte parameters. An increase of temperature induced an increase of haemocyte mortality, in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. Temperature modulated aminopeptidase activity. An in vitro decrease of salinity was associated with cell mortality. During the course of in vivo experiments, an increase of phagocytic activity was reported at 15%. and 50 parts per thousand. Environmental physical parameters may modulate haemocyte activities. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The spatial structure of seagrass landscapes is typically ascribed to the direct influence of physical factors such as hydrodynamics, light, and sediment transport. We studied regularly interspaced banded patterns, formed by elongated patches of seagrass, in a small-scale intertidal ecosystem. We investigated (1) whether the observed spatial patterns may arise from feedback interactions between seagrass and its abiotic environment and (2) whether changes in abiotic conditions may lead to predictable changes in these spatial patterns. Field measurements, experiments, and a spatially explicit computer model identified a "scale-dependent feedback" (a mechanism for spatial self-organization) as a possible cause for the banded patterns. Increased protection from uprooting by improved anchoring with increasing seagrass density caused a local positive feedback. Sediment erosion around seagrass shoots increased with distance through the seagrass bands, hence causing a long-range negative feedback. Measurements across the depth gradient of the intertidal, together with model simulations, demonstrated that seagrass cover and mean patch size were predictably influenced by additional external stress caused by light limitation and desiccation. Thus, our study provides direct empirical evidence for a consistent response of spatial self-organized patterns to changing abiotic conditions, suggesting a potential use for self-organized spatial patterns as stress indicators in ecosystems.},

We predicted that climate warming and CO (2) -enrichment should strengthen trophic cascades by reducing the relative efficiency of predation-resistant herbivores, if herbivore consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. This weakens the insurance effect of herbivore diversity. We tested this prediction using experimental ocean warming and acidification in seagrass mesocosms. Meta-analyses of published experiments first indicated that consumption rate trades off with predation resistance. The experiment then showed that three common herbivores together controlled macroalgae and facilitated seagrass dominance, regardless of climate change. When the predation-vulnerable herbivore was excluded in normal conditions, the two resistant herbivores maintained top-down control. Under warming, however, increased algal growth outstripped control by herbivores and the system became algal-dominated. Consequently, climate change can reduce the relative efficiency of resistant herbivores and weaken the insurance effect of biodiversity.},

abstract = {In a seagrass restoration project, we explored the potential for enhancing the restoration process by excluding antagonistic engineering interactions (i.e., biomechanical warfare) between two ecosystem engineers: the bioturbating lugworm Arenicola marina and the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltii Hornem. Applying a shell layer underneath half of our seagrass transplants successfully reduced adult lugworm density by over 80% and reduced lugworm-induced microtopography (a proxy for lugworm disturbance) at the wave-sheltered site. At the wave-exposed site adult lugworm densities and microtopography were already lower than at the sheltered site but were further reduced in the shell-treated units. Excluding lugworms and their bioengineering effects corresponded well with a strongly enhanced seagrass growth at the wave-sheltered site, which was absent at the exposed site. Enhanced seagrass growth in the present study was fully assigned to the removal of lugworms' negative engineering effects and not to any (indirect) evolving effects such as an altered biogeochemistry or sediment-stabilizing effects by the shell layer. The context-dependency implies that seagrass establishment at the exposed site is not constrained by negative ecosystem-engineering interactions only, but also by overriding physical stresses causing poor growth conditions. Present findings underline that, in addition to recent emphasis on considering positive (facilitating) interactions in ecological theory and practice, it is equally important to consider negative engineering interactions between ecosystem-engineering species. Removal of such negative interactions between ecosystem-engineering species can give a head start to the target species at the initial establishment phase, when positive engineering feedbacks by the target species on itself are still lacking. Though our study was carried out in a marine environment with variable levels of wave disturbance, similar principles may be expected to apply to other ecosystems that are inhabited by ecosystem engineers.},

The etiology of WS is uncertain with limited evidence for the role of a gastrointestinal Rickettsiales-like prokaryote (RLP). We documented for the first time the occurrence of animals with clinical signs of WS and associated morphological changes in another haliotid species, the red abalone H. rufescens. In this study, 60 juvenile red abalone (8 cm) were randomly selected from a farmed population raised at 14$\,^{\circ}$C that was known to have low-intensity RLP infections but lacked clinical signs of WS. The abalone were held in triplicate containers receiving water of approximately 14.7$\,^{\circ}$C (Control, Co) or 18.5$\,^{\circ}$C (elevated temperature, ET) and were fed equally for 220 d.

abstract = {The role of disease in the long-term dynamics of threatened species is poorly quantified, as well as being under-represented in ecology and conservation management. To understand persistent host-pathogen interaction operating in a vulnerable habitat, we quantified dynamics driving patterns of seagrass density using a longitudinal study in a relatively pristine site (Isles of Scilly, UK). Replicated samples of eelgrass (Zostera marina) density and wasting disease prevalence, presumably caused by Labyrinthula zosterae, were taken from five meadows at the height of the growing season, over the years 1997-2010. Data were used to parameterise a population dynamic model, incorporating density-dependent factors and sea temperature records. We found that direct density and disease-mediated feedback operate within a network of local populations. Furthermore, our results indicate that the strength of limitation to seagrass growth by disease was increased at higher temperatures. This modification of the coupled host-pathogen dynamics forms a novel hypothesis to account for dramatic die-backs of Z. marina widely reported elsewhere. Our findings highlight the importance of disease in structuring distributions of vulnerable species, as well as the application of population modelling in order to reveal ecological processes and prioritize future mechanistic investigation.},

By 1981, white abalone densities had declined two orders of magnitude, and the species had virtually disappeared by the early 1990s. From April 1992 through December 1993, we searched 30,600 m2 of suitable habitat at 15 locations known previously to support the white abalone. We found three live individuals (mean density, 0.0002/m2; SE, 0.0005). All three were near the maximum size common for the white abalone. At average densities, an equivalent search in the 1970s would have revealed 6,120--30,600 adults. Fishery landings reflected this population collapse. Annual commercial landings averaged 41 metric tons in 1971--1976, peaked abruptly at 65 tons in 1972, then plummeted to 0.140 ton in 1981; landings averaged only 0.153 ton from 1991 through 1994. Recreational landings, never numerous, virtually ceased after 1983. During the 1992--1993 survey,...},

Captive rearing, whereas successful, has demonstrated that this species is highly susceptible to withering syndrome (WS), a rickettsial disease of abalone; WS has not been demonstrated in remnant wild white abalone populations. Thus, WS may limit white abalone production and supplementation of captive abalone must include measures to preclude the introduction of WS into wild populations. Oxytetracycline (OTC) is approved for use in aquaculture and has been demonstrated to effectively reduce rickettsial loads, WS development, and associated losses. White abalone were medicated at 90.82 mg/kg of OTC daily for 20 days and the efficacy, elimination, and potential to protect against exposure to the WS rickettsia were examined. This study illustrated that OTC effectively eliminates rickettsial infections. High concentrations of OTC (1,089 ppm...},

abstract = {Ecologists would like to explain general patterns observed across multi-species communities, such as species-area and abundance-frequency relationships, in terms of the fundamental processes of birth, death and migration underlying the dynamics of all constituent species. The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and related theories based on these fundamental population processes have successfully recreated general species-abundance patterns without accounting for either the variation among species and individuals or resource-releasing processes such as predation and disturbance, long emphasized in ecological theory. If ecological communities can be described adequately without estimating variation in species and their interactions, our understanding of ecological community organization and the predicted consequences of reduced biodiversity and environmental change would shift markedly. Here, I introduce a strong method to test the neutral theory that combines field parameterization of the underlying population dynamics with a field experiment, and apply it to a rocky intertidal community. Although the observed abundance-frequency distribution of the system follows that predicted by the neutral theory, the neutral theory predicts poorly the field experimental results, indicating an essential role for variation in species interactions.},

abstract = {Self-facilitation through ecosystem engineering (i.e., organism modification of the abiotic environment) and consumer-resource interactions are both major determinants of spatial patchiness in ecosystems. However, interactive effects of these two mechanisms on spatial complexity have not been extensively studied. We investigated the mechanisms underlying a spatial mosaic of low-tide exposed hummocks and waterlogged hollows on an intertidal mudflat in the Wadden Sea dominated by the seagrass Zostera noltii. A combination of field measurements, an experiment and a spatially explicit model indicated that the mosaic resulted from localized sediment accretion by seagrass followed by selective waterfowl grazing. Hollows were bare in winter, but were rapidly colonized by seagrass during the growth season. Colonized hollows were heavily grazed by brent geese and widgeon in autumn, converting these patches to a bare state again and disrupting sediment accretion by seagrass. In contrast, hummocks were covered by seagrass throughout the year and were rarely grazed, most likely because the waterfowl were not able to employ their preferred but water requiring feeding strategy ('dabbling') here. Our study exemplifies that interactions between ecosystem engineering by a foundation species (seagrass) and consumption (waterfowl grazing) can increase spatial complexity at the landscape level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Food web composition and resource levels can influence ecosystem properties such as productivity and elemental cycles. In particular, herbivores occupy a central place in food webs as the species richness and composition of this trophic level may simultaneously influence the transmission of resource and predator effects to higher and lower trophic levels, respectively. Yet, these interactions are poorly understood.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:Using an experimental seagrass mesocosm system, we factorially manipulated water column nutrient concentrations, food chain length, and diversity of crustacean grazers to address two questions: (1) Does food web composition modulate the effects of nutrient enrichment on plant and grazer biomasses and stoichiometry? (2) Do ecosystem fluxes of dissolved oxygen and nutrients more closely reflect above-ground biomass and community structure or sediment processes? Nutrient enrichment and grazer presence generally had strong effects on biomass accumulation, stoichiometry, and ecosystem fluxes, whereas predator effects were weaker or absent. Nutrient enrichment had little effect on producer biomass or net ecosystem production but strongly increased seagrass nutrient content, ecosystem flux rates, and grazer secondary production, suggesting that enhanced production was efficiently transferred from producers to herbivores. Gross ecosystem production (oxygen evolution) correlated positively with above-ground plant biomass, whereas inorganic nutrient fluxes were unrelated to plant or grazer biomasses, suggesting dominance by sediment microbial processes. Finally, grazer richness significantly stabilized ecosystem processes, as predators decreased ecosystem production and respiration only in the zero- and one- species grazer treatments.

CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:Overall, our results indicate that consumer presence and species composition strongly influence ecosystem responses to nutrient enrichment, and that increasing herbivore diversity can stabilize ecosystem flux rates in the face of perturbations.},

title = {{Kelp and Eelgrass in Puget Sound}},
year = {2007},
month = may,
annote = {"Eelgrass
Competitors of eelgrass in Puget Sound include the in- troduced brown seaweed Sargassum muticum (Britton- Simmons 2004), the sand dollar (Dendraster excentricus) and possibly the newly discovered kelp species in Hood Canal, Chorda filum. In situations where there are excessive nutrients, algal species such as sea lettuce (Ulva spp.) will overgrow eelgrass. Excessive nutrients also can cause over- growth by epiphytes on the blades, blocking light, nutrients and gas exchange. Several herbivores (the snail Lacuna spp. and the marine isopod Idotea spp.) can control epiphyte density and thereby benefit the underlying eelgrass (Wil- liams and Ruckleshaus 1993; Nelson and Waaland 1997).
Direct herbivory on eelgrass is usually not significant. Crabs are known to uproot eelgrass (Simenstad et al. 1997), and the sand dollar (Dendraster excentricus) also disturbs the substrate to a degree that excludes eelgrass. However, the Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans), a small sea goose, feeds on eelgrass in large quantities, especially in areas such as Dungeness, Padilla and Samish bays (Baldwin and Lov- vorn 1994). The isopod Synidotea also feeds on eelgrass. Eelgrass can be buried and killed by sand overwash from storms."

abstract = {To date, ecologists and conservation biologists have focused much of their attention on the population and ecosystem effects of disease at regional scales and the role that diseases play in global species extinction. Far less research has been dedicated to identifying the effects that diseases can have on local scale species assemblages. We examined the role of infectious disease in structuring local biodiversity. Our intention was to illustrate how variable outcomes can occur by focusing on three case studies: the influence of chestnut blight on forest communities dominated by chestnut trees, the influence of red-spot disease on urchin barrens and kelp forests, and the influence of sylvatic plague on grassland communities inhabited by prairie dogs. Our findings reveal that at local scales infectious disease seems to play an important, though unpredictable, role in structuring species diversity. Through our case studies, we have shown that diseases can cause drastic population declines or local extirpations in keystone species, ecosystem engineers, and otherwise abundant species. These changes in local diversity may be very important, particularly when considered alongside potentially corresponding changes in community structure and function, and we believe that future efforts to understand the importance of disease to species diversity should have an increased focus on these local scales.},

abstract = {The increasing number of zoonotic diseases spilling over from a range of wild animal species represents a particular concern for public health, especially in light of the current dramatic trend of biodiversity loss. To understand the ecology of these multi-host pathogens and their response to environmental degradation and species extinctions, it is necessary to develop a theoretical framework that takes into account realistic community assemblages. Here, we present a multi-host species epidemiological model that includes empirically determined patterns of diversity and composition derived from community ecology studies. We use this framework to study the interaction between wildlife diversity and directly transmitted pathogen dynamics. First, we demonstrate that variability in community composition does not affect significantly the intensity of pathogen transmission. We also show that the consequences of community diversity can differentially impact the prevalence of pathogens and the number of infectious individuals. Finally, we show that ecological interactions among host species have a weaker influence on pathogen circulation than inter-species transmission rates. We conclude that integration of a community perspective to study wildlife pathogens is crucial, especially in the context of understanding and predicting infectious disease emergence events.},

Both larval production and midstage growth (similar to 120 to similar to 150 mu m) of the oyster Crassostrea gigas were significantly negatively correlated with the aragonite saturation state of waters in which larval oysters were spawned and reared for the first 48 h of life. The effects of the initial spawning conditions did not have a significant effect on early-stage growth (growth from D-hinge stage to similar to 120 mm), suggesting a delayed effect of water chemistry on larval development.},

Although such losses are widely viewed as an ethical and aesthetic problem, recent research reveals extensive cascading effects of their disappearance in marine, terrestrial, and freshwater ecosystems worldwide. This empirical work supports long-standing theory about the role of top-down forcing in ecosystems but also highlights the unanticipated impacts of trophic cascades on processes as diverse as the dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, and biogeochemical cycles. These findings emphasize the urgent need for interdisciplinary research to forecast the effects of trophic downgrading on process, function, and resilience in global ecosystems.},

The topology of these networks is a major determinant of ecosystems' dynamics and is ultimately responsible for their responses to human impacts. Several simple models have been proposed for the intricate food webs observed in nature. We show that the three main models proposed so far fail to fully replicate the empirical data, and we develop a likelihood-based approach for the direct comparison of alternative models based on the full structure of the network. Results drive a new model that is able to generate all the empirical data sets and to do so with the highest likelihood.},

abstract = {Our understanding of the relative influence of different ecological drivers on the number of species in a place remains limited. Assessing the relative influence of local ecological interactions versus regional species pools on local species richness should help bridge this conceptual gap. Plots of local species richness versus regional species pools have been used to address this question, yet after an active quarter-century of research on the relative influence of local interactions versus regional species pools, consensus remains elusive. We propose a conceptual framework that incorporates spatial scale and ecological interaction strength to reconcile current disparities. We then test this framework using a survey of marine rocky intertidal algal and invertebrate communities from the northeast Pacific. We reach two main conclusions. First, these data show that the power of regional species pools to predict local richness disintegrates at small spatial scales coincident with the scale of biological interactions, when studying ecologically interactive groups of species, and in generally more abiotically stressful habitats (e.g., the high intertidal). Second, conclusions of past studies asserting that the regional species pool is the primary driver of local species richness may be artifacts of large spatial scales or ecologically noninteractive groups of species.},

abstract = {The protist Labyrinthula zosterae (Phylum Bigyra, sensu Tsui et al. 2009) has been identified as a causative agent of wasting disease in eelgrass (Zostera marina), of which the most intense outbreak led to the destruction of 90% of eelgrass beds in eastern North America and western Europe in the 1930s. Outbreaks still occur today, albeit at a smaller scale. Traditionally, L. zosterae has been quantified by measuring the necrotic area of Z. marina leaf tissue. This indirect method can however only lead to a very rough estimate of pathogen load. Here, we present a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) approach to directly detect and quantify L. zosterae in eelgrass tissue. Based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of rRNA genes, species-specific primers were designed. Using our qPCR, we were able to quantify accurately and specifically L. zosterae load both from culture and eelgrass leaves using material from Europe and North America. Our detection limit was less than one L. zosterae cell. Our results demonstrate the potential of this qPCR assay to provide rapid, accurate and sensitive molecular identification and quantification of L. zosterae. In view of declining seagrass populations worldwide, this method will provide a valuable tool for seagrass ecologists and conservation projects.},

abstract = {Although invasive species often resemble their native counterparts, differences in their foraging and anti-predator strategies may disrupt native food webs. In a California estuary, we showed that regions dominated by native crabs and native whelks have low mortality of native oysters (the basal prey), while regions dominated by invasive crabs and invasive whelks have high oyster mortality and are consequently losing a biologically diverse habitat. Using field experiments, we demonstrated that the invasive whelk's distribution is causally related to a large-scale pattern of oyster mortality. To determine whether predator-prey interactions between crabs (top predators) and whelks (intermediate consumers) indirectly control the pattern of oyster mortality, we manipulated the presence and invasion status of the intermediate and top trophic levels in laboratory mesocosms. Our results show that native crabs indirectly maintain a portion of the estuary's oyster habitat by both consuming native whelks (density-mediated trophic cascade) and altering their foraging behavior (trait-mediated trophic cascade). In contrast, invasive whelks are naive to crab predators and fail to avoid them, thereby inhibiting trait-mediated cascades and their invasion into areas with native crabs. Similarly, when native crabs are replaced with invasive crabs, the naive foraging strategy and smaller size of invasive crabs prevents them from efficiently consuming adult whelks, thereby inhibiting strong density-mediated cascades. Thus, while trophic cascades allow native crabs, whelks, and oysters to locally co-exist, the replacement of native crabs and whelks by functionally similar invasive species results in severe depletion of native oysters. As coastal systems become increasingly invaded, the mismatch of evolutionarily based strategies among predators and prey may lead to further losses of critical habitat that support marine biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

abstract = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

abstract = {Bacterial diseases are a major cause of larval mortality in shellfish hatcheries. Even with proper sanitation measures, bacterial pathogens cannot be eliminated in all cases. The pathogenicity of bacteria isolated from Pacific Northwest shellfish hatcheries to Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas larvae was investigated. We found 3 highly pathogenic strains and 1 mildly pathogenic strain among 33 isolates tested. These strains appear to be members of the genus Vibrio. Although there have been many studies of bivalve bacterial pathogens, a standard method to assess bacterial pathogenicity in bivalve larvae is needed. Thus, we developed 2 methods using either 15 ml conical tubes or tissue culture plates that were employed for rapidly screening bacterial strains for pathogenicity to Pacific oyster larvae. The tissue culture plates worked well for screening both mildly pathogenic strains and LD50 (lethal dose) assays. This method allowed for non-intrusive and non-destructive observation of the oyster larvae with a dissecting microscope. The LD50 for the 3 highly pathogenic strains ranged between 1.6 and 3.6 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU) ml(-1) after 24 h and between 3.2 x 10(2) and 1.9 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) after 48 h.},

abstract = {Seagrasses evolved from terrestrial plants into marine foundation species around 100 million years ago. Their ecological success, however, remains a mystery because natural organic matter accumulation within the beds should result in toxic sediment sulfide levels. Using a meta-analysis, a field study, and a laboratory experiment, we reveal how an ancient three-stage symbiosis between seagrass, lucinid bivalves, and their sulfide-oxidizing gill bacteria reduces sulfide stress for seagrasses. We found that the bivalve-sulfide-oxidizer symbiosis reduced sulfide levels and enhanced seagrass production as measured in biomass. In turn, the bivalves and their endosymbionts profit from organic matter accumulation and radial oxygen release from the seagrass roots. These findings elucidate the long-term success of seagrasses in warm waters and offer new prospects for seagrass ecosystem conservation.},

abstract = {Models of the effects of disturbance on ecological communities have largely considered communities of competing species at a single trophic level. In contrast, most real communities have multiple interacting trophic levels. I explored several versions of simple single- and multitrophic models to determine whether predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH), derived from considering only a single trophic level, apply to multitrophic situations. The IDH was predicted by models of competing species at a single trophic level but did not hold in many situations with more natural trophic structure. In general, basal species in a food web tended to follow the IDH, whereas competitors at top trophic levels did not. Additional analyses indicated that outside immigration interacted with trophic structure to produce widely differing predictions about the consequences of disturbance and that density-dependent disturbance events could recapture the IDH in some multiple trophic level situations. Model predictions matched the results of empirical studies to date: the IDH has generally been supported for species competing for nondynamic basal resources but not for mobile aquatic invertebrates at higher trophic levels. The model analysis also verified basic predictions of verbal models addressing the effects of physical stress. Three different aspects of disturbance and their contributions to species coexistence were identified: changes in average mortality rates, changes in temporal variability, and changes in spatial heterogeneity. The results indicate that the IDH should be applied with caution to real multitrophic communities.},

abstract = {Seagrasses are unique plants; the only group of flowering plants to recolonise the sea. They occur on every continental margin, except Antarctica, and form ecosystems which have important roles in fisheries, fish nursery grounds, prawn fisheries, habitat diversity and sediment stabilisation. Over the last two decades there has been an explosion of research and information on all aspects of seagrass biology. However the compilation of all this work into one book has not been attempted previously. In this book experts in 26 areas of seagrass biology present their work in chapters which are state-of--the-art and designed to be useful to students and researchers alike. The book not only focuses on what has been discovered but what exciting areas are left to discover. The book is divided into sections on taxonomy, anatomy, reproduction, ecology, physiology, fisheries, management, conservation and landscape ecology. It is destined to become the chosen text on seagrasses for any marine biology course.},

abstract = {During 2006 and 2007, we documented the re-emergence of severe episodes of vibriosis caused by Vibrio tubiashii in shellfish hatcheries on the west coast of North America. Lost larval and juvenile production included 3 previously undescribed hosts, Pacific (Crassostrea gigas) and Kumamoto (C. sikamea) oysters and geoduck clams Panope abrupta, with a 2007 decline in larval oyster production of similar to 59 % in one hatchery. Losses of larval and juvenile bivalves were linked to V. tubiashii blooms in the coastal environment, which were associated with the apparent mixing of unusually warm surface seawater and intermittently upwelled cooler, nutrient- and Vibrio spp.-enriched seawater. The ocean temperature elevation anomaly in 2007 was not clearly linked to an El Nino event, as was a similar episode in 1998. Concentrations of the dominant shellfish-pathogenic vibrios were as high as 1.6 x 10(6) cfu ml(-1) in the cold, upwelled water. The bacteria possessed the genes coding for a protease and hemolysin described for V tubiashii, and pathogenic isolates secreted these peptides. Lesions resulting from a classic invasive disease and a toxigenic noninvasive disease occurred in oyster and geoduck clam larvae. Management and prevention require reduction of incoming concentrations of the bacteria, reduction of contamination in water and air supplies and in stock chemical solutions, removal of bacterial toxins, and interruption of the cycle of bacterial amplification in the hatchery and in microalgal food supplies.},

abstract = {Recovery of an ecosystem following disturbance can be severely hampered or even shift altogether when a point disturbance exceeds a certain spatial threshold. Such scale-dependent dynamics may be caused by preemptive competition, but may also result from diminished self-facilitation due to weakened ecosystem engineering. Moreover, disturbance can facilitate colonization by engineering species that alter abiotic conditions in ways that exacerbate stress on the original species. Consequently, establishment of such counteracting engineers might reduce the spatial threshold for the disturbance, by effectively slowing recovery and increasing the risk for ecosystem shifts to alternative states. We tested these predictions in an intertidal mudflat characterized by a two-state mosaic of hummocks (humps exposed during low tide) dominated by the sediment-stabilizing seagrass Zostera noltii) and hollows (low-tide waterlogged depressions dominated by the bioturbating lugworm Arenicola marina). In contrast to expectations, seagrass recolonized both natural and experimental clearings via lateral expansion and seemed unaffected by both clearing size and lugworm addition. Near the end of the growth season, however, an additional disturbance (most likely waterfowl grazing and/or strong hydrodynamics) selectively impacted recolonizing seagrass in the largest (1 m(2)) clearings (regardless of lugworm addition), and in those medium (0.25 m(2)) clearings where lugworms had been added nearly five months earlier. Further analyses showed that the risk for the disturbance increased with hollow size, with a threshold of 0.24 m(2). Hollows of that size were caused by seagrass removal alone in the largest clearings, and by a weaker seagrass removal effect exacerbated by lugworm bioturbation in the medium clearings. Consequently, a sufficiently large disturbance increased the vulnerability of recolonizing seagrass to additional disturbance by weakening seagrass engineering effects (sediment stabilization). Meanwhile, the counteracting ecosystem engineering (lugworm bioturbation) reduced that threshold size. Therefore, scale-dependent interactions between habitat-mediated facilitation, competition and disturbance seem to maintain the spatial two-state mosaic in this ecosystem.},

abstract = {Edge effects are a dominant subject in landscape ecology literature, yet they are highly variable and poorly understood. Often, the literature suggests simple models for edge effects-positive (enhancement at the edge), negative (enhancement at the interior), or no effect (neutral)--on a variety of metrics, including abundance, diversity, and mortality. In the marine realm, much of this work has focused on fragmented seagrass habitats due to their importance for a variety of commercially important species. In this study, the settlement, recruitment, and survival of bay scallops was investigated across a variety of seagrass patch treatments. By simultaneously collecting settlers (those viable larvae available to settle and metamorphose) and recruits (those settlers that survive some period of time, in this case, 6 weeks) on the same collectors, we were able to demonstrate a "balance" between positive and negative edge effects, resulting in a net neutral effect. Scallop settlement was significantly enhanced along seagrass edges, regardless of patch type while survival was elevated within patch interiors. However, recruitment (the net result of settlement and post-settlement loss) did not vary significantly from edge to center, representing a neutral effect. Further, results suggest that post-settlement loss, most likely due to predation, appears to be the dominant mechanism structuring scallop abundance, not patterns in settlement. These data illustrate the complexity of edge effects, and suggest that the metric used to investigate the effect (be it abundance, survival, or other metrics) can often influence the magnitude and direction of the perceived effect. Traditionally, high predation along a habitat edge would have indicated an "ecological trap" for the species in question; however, this study demonstrates that, at the population level, an ecological trap may not exist.},

abstract = {Determining the strengths of interactions among species in natural communities presents a major challenge to ecology. Using an approach combining experimental perturbations and path analysis, I examined the mechanisms by which birds directly and indirectly affected other members of an intertidal community, evaluated alternative causal hypotheses, and predicted whether interactions among the unmanipulated species would be strong or weak. Comparing treatments with t tests indicated that excluding bird predators with cages caused increases in Pollicipes polymerus, and declines in Nucella spp., Mytilus californianus, and Semibalanus cariosus. However, these conclusions provided no insight into the underlying mechanisms causing the differences. Path analysis permitted insight into the causal mechanisms by making a variety of predictions about the strength of direct interactions: (a) Bird predation negatively affects Pollicipes, but not Nucella, Leptasterias, or Mytilus; (b) Pollicipes reduces Semibalanus and M...},
